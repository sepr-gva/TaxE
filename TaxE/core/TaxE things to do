Things to do:
	- Add buttons to the play space (buying trains and traversing trains)
	- Rail that links up correctly and can be drawn in correct orientation
	- Cities that you can click on and buy trains in
	- Being able to take a turn
	- Giving resources at the beginning of turns + when completing goals
	- "Random goals" - 0 goals => give one, less than 3 => maybe
	- Being able to traverse trains
