TaxE
====

Trains across Europe (TaxE) is a two player, objective-centric, simultaneous turn-based tower defense game.
Each turn both players are given objectives to send a train from a station to another station or stations.
They must plan out the route to take down one of many railroads. Completing objectives rewards a player with gold and points.
Players can spend resources to upgrade their trains in various ways or to purchase towers, which can be placed within the gamespace strategically to attack enemy trains that pass within range.
Victory is achieved by having the greatest number of points within a time limit.
